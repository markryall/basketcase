<h1> BasketCase </h1>

<blockquote>  
BasketCase is a (Ruby) script that encapsulates the Rational ClearCase
command-line interface, "<code>cleartool</code>", making it (slightly) more
comfortable for developers more used to non-locking version-control systems
such as CVS or Subversion.
</blockquote>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>BasketCase can help you:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>List</strong> modified elements.</li>
  <li><strong>Update</strong> a snapshot view, with <strong>automatic
  merge</strong> of changes to checked-out elements.</li>
  <li><strong>Check-out</strong> (unreserved) and <strong>check-in</strong>
  elements.</li>
  <li><strong>Undo a check-out</strong>, reverting to the base version.</li>
  <li><strong>Add</strong>, <strong>remove</strong> and
  <strong>rename</strong> elements.</li>
  <li>Display <strong>differences</strong> for modified elements.</li>
  <li>Display <strong>change-logs</strong> and
  <strong>version-trees</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
All of the above will seem rather banal to CVS/Subversion users; that's the
point - BasketCase is intended to make ClearCase usage intuitive and
straightforward, ie. boring.
</p>

<h2>Getting BasketCase</h2>

<p>You can grab the <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/*checkout*/trunk/bin/basketcase.rb?root=basketcase">latest
version of <code>basketcase.rb</code></a> directly from RubyForge SVN.</p>

<h2>Why BasketCase?</h2>

<p>
In May 2006, Mike Williams was stuck on a client project which (despite the
team's wishes) was stuck using ClearCase as it's version-control system.
He wrote BasketCase in frustration.
</p>

<p>
The team was attempting to use Agile practices such as collective code
ownership, refactoring and continuous-integration, and ClearCase was in the
way:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Depending on the setup, ClearCase likes to do "reserved" check-outs
  of elements, preventing collective code ownership.</li>
  <li>When add, removing or moving elements, ClearCase will sometimes apply
  the change to the repository immediately, without waiting for a
  "commit".</li>
  <li>When updating, ClearCase will not attempt to merge other developers'
  changes to elements you have checked-out; this can leave your view in an
  inconsistent state.</li>
  <li>Performing an automatic merge from the command-line requires an
  unwieldy, obscure command.</li>
  <li>There is no easy way to do a bulk-commit.</li>
</ul>
