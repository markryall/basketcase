<h1> BasketCase </h1>

<blockquote>  
BasketCase is a (Ruby) script that encapsulates the Rational ClearCase
command-line interface, "<code>cleartool</code>", making it (slightly) more
comfortable for developers more used to non-locking version-control systems
such as CVS or Subversion.
</blockquote>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>BasketCase can help you:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>List</strong> modified elements.</li>
  <li><strong>Update</strong> a snapshot view, with <strong>automatic merge</strong> of changes to checked-out elements.</li>
  <li><strong>Check-out</strong> (unreserved) and <strong>check-in</strong> elements.</li>
  <li><strong>Undo a check-out</strong>, reverting to the base version.</li>
  <li><strong>Add</strong>, <strong>remove</strong> and <strong>rename</strong> elements.</li>
  <li>Display <strong>change-logs</strong> and <strong>version-trees</strong>.</li>
  <li>Display <strong>differences</strong> for modified elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>
All of the above will seem rather banal to CVS/Subversion users; that's the
point - BasketCase is intended to make ClearCase usage intuitive and
straightforward, ie. boring.

<h3>Why BasketCase?</h3>

<p>
In mid-2006, Mike Williams worked on a client project which, despite the
team's wishes, was burdened with ClearCase as it's source-code control
system.
</p>

<p>
The team was attempting to use Agile practices such as collective code
ownership, refactoring and continuous-integration, and ClearCase was in the
way:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>ClearCase enables and in many ways favours "reserved" check-outs of
  elements, preventing collective code ownership.</li>
  <li>When add, removing or moving elements, ClearCase will sometimes apply
  the change to the repository immediately, without waiting for a
  "commit".</li>
  <li>When updating, ClearCase will not attempt to merge other developers'
  changes to elements you have checked-out; this can leave your view in an
  inconsistent state.</li>
  <li>Performing an automatic merge from the command-line requires an
  unwieldy, obscure command.</li>
  <li>There is no easy way to do a bulk-commit from the command-line.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Mike wrote BasketCase in frustration.
