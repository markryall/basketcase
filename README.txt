= basketcase

BasketCase is a (Ruby) script that encapsulates the Rational ClearCase
command-line interface, <code>cleartool</code>, making it (slightly) more
comfortable for developers more used to non-locking version-control systems
such as CVS or Subversion.

== Features

BasketCase can help you:

* <strong>List</strong> modified elements.
* <strong>Update</strong> a snapshot view, including <strong>automatic merge</strong> of modified elements.
* <strong>Check-out</strong> (unreserved) and <strong>check-in</strong> elements.
* <strong>Undo a check-out</strong>, reverting to the base version.
* Perform a <strong>bulk check-in</strong> (or revert).
* <strong>Add</strong>, <strong>remove</strong> and <strong>rename</strong> elements.
* Display <strong>change-logs</strong> and <strong>version-trees</strong>.
* Display <strong>differences</strong> for modified elements.

== Background

In mid-2006, Mike Williams worked on a client project which, despite the
team's wishes, was burdened with ClearCase as it's source-code control
system.

The team was attempting to use Agile practices such as collective code
ownership, refactoring and continuous-integration, and ClearCase was in the
way:

* ClearCase enables and in many ways favours "reserved" check-outs of
  elements, preventing collective code ownership.
* When add, removing or moving elements, ClearCase will sometimes apply the
  change to the repository immediately, without waiting for a "commit".
* When updating, ClearCase will not attempt to merge other developers'
  changes to elements you have checked-out ... leaving your view in an
  inconsistent state.
* Performing an automatic merge from the command-line requires an unwieldy,
  obscure command.
* There is no easy way to do a bulk-commit from the command-line.

Mike wrote BasketCase in frustration.
